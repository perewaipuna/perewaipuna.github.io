Learning through doing




CNAME

If you want a custom domain (i.e. matthewkudija.com instead of mkudija.github.io), perform the following:

1   Buy the domain from your preferred DNS provider. I use Host Gator.
2   Add a CNAME file to your directory. This should contain just the domain: matthewkudija.com.
3   Contact your DNS provider to point to GitHub pages. Refer to the documentation.
