Learning through doing




CNAME

If you want a custom domain (i.e. matthewkudija.com instead of mkudija.github.io), perform the following:<p>
1   Buy the domain from your preferred DNS provider. I use Host Gator.<p>	
2   Add a CNAME file to your directory. This should contain just the domain: matthewkudija.com.<p>
3   Contact your DNS provider to point to GitHub pages. Refer to the documentation.<p>
